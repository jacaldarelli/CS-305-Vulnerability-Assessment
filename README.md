Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
My client, Artemis Financial, is concerned with the software security of their web based application. Since this application deals with sensitive data, it is extremely important to maintain secure software. 

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I did particularly well taking in this new material and collaborating with my peers to progress through the assignment.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
As this is fresh material for myself, I found I needed feedback on issues that presented themselves. I got this through peer collaboration and resources. Specifically, I found the suppression of false positive dependencies to be challenging.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
It is always important to consider security with software, especially with such a client that is dealing with sensitive data. Running the dependency checks appears to be a great go-to for determining issues in an efficient mannor, I would definitely deploy this again.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Running the code, as well as a before and after dependency check, were the tactics I utilized for ensuring a smooth functiuon and checking for new vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Collaborating with my peers to recieve some sort of feedback through this course was very helpful. Also, maintaining good practice of clearly commenting code was beneficial.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would showcase this assignmnet with an explanation that this is all new material for me, and that I am proud of my ability to take on new material and basically teach myself.
